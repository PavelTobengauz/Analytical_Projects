# Bank customers churn rate analysis

### The main goal:
To identify the main factors of churn, to build the main churn segments and to give recommedations on working with them.

### Project description:
We have a dataset of customers of the bank which works in three cities in Russia. The dataset contains different information of bank's customers including the churn indicator. The bank needs us to identify the factors that affect the churn, to form some segments of the customers that have high churn rate. We can cross the factors, one customer can be in two or more segments but all the segments must include at least 500 customers. We also need to give recommendations how to work with different segments.

### Result:
As a result, we have identified the key churn factors, have made 4 segments and have given different recommendations on working with them.
