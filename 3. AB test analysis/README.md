# A/B test results analysis

### The main goal:
To test the changes connected with the introduction of an improved recommender system.

### Project description:
There is a one app which made the A/B test to check whether a new recommender system is better than the old. We have a dataset with user actions, terms of reference and several auxiliary datasets. According the TOR, it is expected that users will show an improvement in each metric by at least 10%.

### Result:
As a result, according to the results of the A/B test, it was found that there is a statistically significant difference between groups A and B in terms of conversion to the product page. At the same time, the conversion in group A is higher at each stage. This suggests that the new recommender system performed worse than the old one.
