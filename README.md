# Projects at Practicum by Yandex
This is the repository with some projects I finished during the Data Analysis Professional Training Course at Practicum by Yandex.

## Projects list
1. Churn rate analysis. The main goal is to identify the main factors that affect the customers churn and to form some segments with the highest churn rate.
2. App clients behaviour analysis. The main goal is to identify the causes of losing money and to give recommendations how to improve the situation.
