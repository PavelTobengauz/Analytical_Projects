Hello! I'm Pavel Tobengauz, the Director of the Analytics department at a small Russian company. I'm currently seeking for a job opportunities in Germany. To enhance my hard skills, I recently completed the Data Analysis Professional Training Course at Practicum by Yandex, totalling 350 hours.  I would like to share some of the projects I successfully completed during the course.

## Projects list
1. Churn rate analysis. The main goal is to identify the main factors that affect the customers churn and to form some segments with the highest churn rate.
2. App clients behaviour analysis. The main goal is to identify the causes of losing money and to give recommendations how to improve the situation.
