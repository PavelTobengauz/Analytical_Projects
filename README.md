Hello! I'm Pavel Tobengauz. I'm a Director of Analytics department in a small russian company, looking for a job in Europe. To improve my hard skills, I finished the Data Analysis Professional Training Course at Practicum by Yandex (350 hours). There are some projects which I completed during the course.

## Projects list
1. Churn rate analysis. The main goal is to identify the main factors that affect the customers churn and to form some segments with the highest churn rate.
2. App clients behaviour analysis. The main goal is to identify the causes of losing money and to give recommendations how to improve the situation.
